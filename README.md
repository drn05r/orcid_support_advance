The ORCID Support Advance Plugin builds upon the functionality of the 
[ORCID Support Plugin](https://github.com/eprints/orcid_support). It allows
to import to the user's work area and export to their orcid.org profile.
To use the plugin in your EPrints repository you need to have access to the
ORCID Member API.

The documentation is hosted in the EPrints Wiki: https://wiki.eprints.org/w/ORCID_Support#ORCID_Support_Advance

The ORCID Support Advance Plugin is also available on the [EPrints Bazaar](http://bazaar.eprints.org/).
